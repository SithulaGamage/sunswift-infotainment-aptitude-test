## Question One - What makes a race car infotainment system different from a normal mobile app?

## Question Two - Identify and explain four key principles of good infotainment system design.

## Question Three - Describe how you would test an infotainment interface to ensure it is safe and reliable.

### Executive Summary
Testing an infotainment system requires validating both software reliability and driver safety. Unlike typical consumer applications or some low level everyday systems, automotive interfaces operate in harsh physical environments whilst directly impacting the driver's attention.

#### Stress Testing
##### Testing Approach
* Simulate at least 10x the normal telemtry rates and burst patterns
* Thoroughly monitor the UI frame rate, touch latency, and memory stability
* Verify critical display warnings with a very short time frame (200ms) no matter the system load

#### Key Requirements
Implement a form of priority queuing where the safety-critical alerts (overheating, brake failtures etc.) are shown before the non-essential updates. It is important to test the telemtry system with correlated sensor data in connection to the rest of the entire system, instead of just random values.

### Network Dropouts and Corrupted Messages
#### Fault Injection
* Test complete networks loss and delayed delivery
* Inject malformed data (invalid formatting, type mismatches, and out-of-range values)

#### Critical Requirements
* The system shoudl never crash due to bad data. There should be a silent form of discarding.
* Automatic reconnection after network restoration without user intervention

### Environmental Testing
#### Temperature
Test extreme ranges of thermal cycling (-40°C to +85°C). Verify the correct operations happen at the extremes.

#### Vibration 
Test a wide range of frequencies (10 - 2000 Hz) which could shock the system when in the harsh environments.

### UI Performance
#### Performance Monitoring
* A target of 60 fps should be aimed for.
* There should be a form of touch response where the driver sees recognition of acknowledgement in < 50-100 ms.

### Driver Readability
#### Readibility
* Critical for the driver to be able to comprehend the information in < 1-2 second glances.
* There should be tests done in actual vehicles under varied scenarios/environments such as different lighting or weather.
* It is important to have large touch targets which have high contrast.

### Integration and System Testing
#### Real-World Validation
* Continous integration with automated tests on every commit

#### Safety Certification
* Compliance with all safety integrity levels
